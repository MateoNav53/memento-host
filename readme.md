**Project Overview**  
- Memento is a personal diary app that has the same functionality as a physical diary would.  

**Details on Functionality**
- The user can write new diary entries, view how many entries have been written, and read the details of past diary entries. Past diaries are stored in a database thanks to the built in Django admin.  

**Technologies Used**  
- This application was built with Django 3.0, Python 3.8, HTML for templates, and Bootstrap/CSS for styling. Diary entries are saved thanks to the built-in Django datase through the admin.  

**Ideas for Future Improvement**  
1. Add a feature that lets people log in and save diary entries to a profile. Right now only one user can write diaries and save data.  

2. Add edit and delete functionality for diary entries.  

3.  Add a background image to the home page, or add one for the whole site.
